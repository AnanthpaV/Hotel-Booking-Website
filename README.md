<<<<<<< HEAD

## Overview
Hotel Booking Website is a full-stack web application consisting of a backend built with Node.js and Express, and a frontend developed using React and Vite. The backend handles API requests, authentication, and database operations, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

## Features
- Backend:
  - RESTful API
  - Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  - Database operations using MongoDB and Mongoose
  - File uploads using Multer
- Frontend:
  - React-based UI
  - Routing with React Router
  - State management
  - Integration with backend APIs

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

## Installation

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure the environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string).
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running the Application
1. Ensure the backend server is running.
2. Start the frontend development server.
3. Open the frontend application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment
- Backend: Deploy the `backend` directory to a Node.js hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
- Frontend: Build the frontend using `npm run build` and deploy the `dist` folder to a static hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
